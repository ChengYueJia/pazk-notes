# Fiat Shamir

In public-coin interactive proof or argument, any coin tossed by the verifier V is visible for the prover P as soon as it's tossed.
These coin tosses are interpreted as “random challenges” sent by V to P. And in a public-coin protocol “random challenges” are the only messages sent from V to P.

The Fiat-Shamir can transform any public-coin protocol I into a non-interactive, publicly verifiable protocol Q. 


## Preliminaries

### Public-coin
A public-coin algorithm is an algorithm in which all random values are derived publicly - i.e. without the need for 
private information or evaluation methods.
