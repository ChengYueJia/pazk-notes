# The Power of Randomness: Fingerprinting and Freivalds’ Algorithm


## Reed-Solomon Fingerprinting

> The proof systems covered in this survey derive much of their power and efficiency from their use of ran- domness

> Before we discuss the details of such proof systems, let us first develop an appreciation for how randomness can be exploited to dramatically improve the efficiency of certain algorithms. 

Accordingly, in this section, there are no untrusted provers or computationally weak verifiers. Rather, we consider two parties, Alice and Bob, who trust each other and want to cooperate to jointly compute a certain function of their inputs.
