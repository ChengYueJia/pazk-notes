# Definitions and Technical Preliminaries



## Schwartz-Zippel Lemma
TODO- to dig out more info with permutation.



## Univariate/Multilinear Low-degree Extension

### univariable function
* domain: {0, 1, ..., n-1}
  domain len is n
* ULE max-degree: (n-1)
  univariable low-degree extension


### multivariate function
For v-variate funtion:
* domain: ${0,1}^v$
    domain len is 2^v
* MLE max-degree: v
    because the degree of each variable is at most 1.
    Compared with uni-variable, multivariate's degree is cheap.
