# Univariate Lagrange Interpolation
TODO


## background
* aim
To encode vectors into polynomials with(coefficient form)

### Univariate Polynomial Repr
f(x): aX
* x: domain
* y: evaluation
* a: coefficient
* X: basis

### Lagrange Interpolation

So, when we wanna encode vector into polynomials, we can regard vector as
domain(x), evaluation(y), coefficient(a).
> why no one regard the encoded vector as domain?
> maybe poly can be express in coeffs and evaluate form(lots of points(x, y))

1. regard vector as coefficients
2. regard vector as evaluations


## Lagrange basis polynomials
